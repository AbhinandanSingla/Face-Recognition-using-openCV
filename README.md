# Face-Recognition-using-openCV

Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individualâ€™s identity using their face. Facial recognition
systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time.

Facial recognition is a category of biometric security. Other forms of biometric software include voice recognition,
fingerprint recognition, and eye retina or iris recognition. The technology is mostly used for security and law
enforcement, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use.

# How to work with Face Recognition.

## Step 1:Face Sampling

##### Run `FaceCapture.py` to take the sample of face.

##### it will automatically save your sample in faces folder.

for Running faceCapture in terminal use the command
`python FaceCapture.py`

## Step 2: Face Detection

##### Run the `FaceDetection.py` script in terminal using `python FaceDetection.py` command or can simply run in Pycharm

# Contribution:
* Jaskiran Kaur Walia(102283023) : Made the main FaceDetection script to detect and recognise the face.

* Komal(102283043) and Nancy(102283037): Made the FaceCapture Script to take the sample of faces.

* Serra Verma(102103731): Made the Documentation of this project.
